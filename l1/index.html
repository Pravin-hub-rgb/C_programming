            <h1>Why Learn C Programming Language?</h1>

            <p>In todays world if we are learning any programming Language then we definately insure that the language is stable in last 5 years and also have a good position in user stats</p>
            <p>Within few years C programming is going to celebrate its 50th birthday. In last 50 years C has performed very well and also programmers love it by heart.</p>
            <p>C programming popularity has been increasing day by day and it will keep on increasing. It looks like the scope of C programming will not end in near future.</p>
            <p>And according to Developer Survey Results 2019 C programming language is one of the top 10 languages</p>
            <p>C programming in software market is one of the most popular and demanding skills and if you know C programming then your chances to get hire increases because C is fast, popular and easy to use. Yes C is easy to use if you know some constructs
                and know how to use those constructs and write a good programs so C is very powerfull.</p>

            <div class="inside-content" id="t2">
                <h1>Why C is so fast?</h1>
                <p>
                    Because in C programmers have many controls, programmer can manage its own memory. If programmer plan its logic and algorithm then he can be close to machine learning codes. If you will use the same logic in python then it will not work fast. So if you
                    need speed then you should use C programming language. If you are making a game engine where you want that by pressing a button it do some actions then C is used.
                </p>

                <div class=" in ">
                    <h2>
                        What are the things that are build in C
                    </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linux operating system, Windows OS, Mac OS</li>
                        <li>MySQL database</li>
                        <li>Ruby and Pearl programming languages</li>
                        <li>First compiler of Java</li>
                        <li>Apache and NGINX (related to web servers [to surf websites])</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Reason? Because C is the lowest level portable language means - that with C we have so much controls that we can reach to CPU instructions
                    </p>
                    <p>More lowest language than C is <a href=" ">assembly language</a> but in assembly language coding is very difficult</p>
                    <p>Some keywords that you will learn later <a href=" ">CPU instructions</a>,&nbsp;<a href=" ">CPU cycles</a></p>
                    <p>Some python libraries are written in C, So C is used to support other programming languages so that they run faster.</p>

                </div>
                <p>If you know C programming than C++ will be very easy.</p>
                <p>The one who does competitive programming they also use C or C++</p>
                <div class="in ">
                    <p>C programming is used where the we need to squeeze our performence more or want more performance out of our programs in less time and with high accuracy.</p>
