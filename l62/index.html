                                <li>The RAM will hold data, programs, and information as long as it has a constant power supply but immediately the power is interrupted all that content is cleared.</li>

                        <li>RAM is not able to handle quite large amount of data due to its small size relative to the hard disk.</li>
                        <li>It is easy to transfer data as files.</li>
